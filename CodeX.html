            <h3>Overview</h3>
                <hr>

            <p >Embarking on the Code Basics Resume Project Challenge 6, I exclusively employed Microsoft PowerBI for the analysis of survey data from the CodeX marketing team. This project centered around generating a robust Power BI report, presenting essential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), key client details, and preferences related to energy drinks. The overarching goal was to derive actionable insights and propose effective marketing strategies for enhancing brand awareness, market share, and product development. I appreciate the Codebasics team for providing the opportunity to undertake and contribute to this impactful project using PowerBI exclusively.</p>    
          
          <h3>Project Introduction</h3>
            <hr>

        <p >CodeX, a German beverage company, endeavors to establish its presence in the Indian market. Having recently launched their energy drink in 10 cities across India, the Marketing team is dedicated to amplifying brand awareness, expanding market share, and facilitating product development. A comprehensive survey was conducted in these 10 cities, yielding responses from 10,000 participants. Assigned as the marketing data analyst, I, in the role of Peter Pandey, undertook the responsibility of transforming these survey results into insightful data. The primary aim is to provide the team with actionable insights to guide strategic decisions. Commencing this project,
             I outlined key objectives for a thorough and meaningful analysis.</p>
