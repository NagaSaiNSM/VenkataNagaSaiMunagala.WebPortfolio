            <h3>Overview</h2>
                <hr>

            <p >The 'Danny's Dinner' SQL project, part of the #8WeekSQLChallenge, is a comprehensive exploration into the intricacies of SQL to derive valuable insights from a restaurant's database. This initiative aims to dissect data, unraveling revenue patterns, and pinpointing menu favorites. The focus is on strategic data utilization to enhance the overall success of Danny's Dinner, navigating through a complex data landscape.</p>    
          
          <h3>Project Introduction</h2>
            <hr>

        <p>In the beginning of 2021, Danny Ma ventured into a risky yet passion-driven venture, opening 'Danny’s Diner' specializing in his top three favorite Japanese foods: sushi, curry, and ramen. The restaurant, 'Danny’s Diner,' seeks assistance to translate their basic operational data into valuable insights for better business management. The primary goal is to understand customer visiting patterns, spending habits, and menu preferences to enhance the overall dining experience and potentially expand the existing customer loyalty program.</p>
