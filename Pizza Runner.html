        <p>In the realm of data science, the Pizza Runner Challenge aimed at optimizing Danny Ma's visionary venture, Pizza Runner.

Anchored by robust data cleansing, this project emphasized data's pivotal role in steering Pizza Runner towards operational excellence. The entity relationship diagram served as a testament to informed decision-making and strategic elevation.</p>
